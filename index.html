 <h3 id="Backstory">The Classic Backstory :-</h3>
    <p>Through historical references, stories and anecdotes shared by our key collaborators, we would like to take you on a wistful trip down memory lane to live the legacy of the Timeless Classic - from its inception, captured in a monochromatic photograph of the G2 Model, to the journey it took to becoming the most loved motorcycle across the globe.Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire, England, sold motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers and stationary engines which it manufactured. Enfield Cycle Company also used the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal".
The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built.The company started a decade earlier (November 1891), and like many car and bike makers, it didn't start off manufacturing what it would eventually become famous for. Two Englishmen -- Bob Walker Smith and Albert Eadie -- decided to buy an already existing company called George Townsend & Co. located in Hunt End, Redditch, a district within the county of Worcestershire, England. Yes, the same county where the world-famous and infamously hard-to-pronounce sauce comes from.</p>
